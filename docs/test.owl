        <dc:description>A state refers to a class of manifestations. It may be a precondition or effect of some Activity, or more generally it may enabled or be caused by some Activity. If a state is complex, it may refer to some combination of classes of manifestations.
A note on complex states:
Say that a shopping activity, Activity-Shop, requires both the VehicleW30LGas state, but also some state wherein the mall is open, OpenMall. Each state would first be defined separately. Then, we can simply state:
precondition(VehicleW30LGas,Activity-Shop) AND  precondition(OpenMall,Activity-Shop)
were the preconditions required disjunctively, we could state:
precondition(VehicleW30LGas,Activity-Shop) OR precondition(OpenMall,Activity-Shop)
However, in large and complex domains, there will be cases in which the above approach is undesirable. In particular, due to the complexity of the description that results as the state being described becomes more detailed. In many cases it will be more natural and convenient to be able to refer to a single, aggregate state. We therefore extend the representation of States to capture aggregation, as approached in the concept of state trees introduced by TOVE as a construct for the activity cluster.

A State may be either non-terminal or terminal. A terminal state has no child states, and therefore refers directly to a class of manifestations, whereas a non-terminal state has child states, which may define some classes of manifestations, or further define some other complex states.
	NonTerminalState(x) v TerminalState(x) = State(x)
A state  cannot be both non-terminal and terminal.
	TerminalState disjointWith NonTerminalState</dc:description>

        <dc:description>A terminal state type has no substates (cannot be decomposed). It corresponds to a particular class of manifestations. A terminal state is achieved at some time if and only if there exists a manifestation within its defined classification, that exists at that time.

hasResource: links to the resource participating in the state
hasQuantity: specifies the quantity of resource participating in the state</dc:description>
